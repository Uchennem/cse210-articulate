Obi Nwobi Obi described greed as a way of life "In life sometimes you get a little rocks and sometimes you find a few gems. Don't stop trying because the gems are calling". Collect as the falling gems and avoid the falling rocks.

## Getting Started
Make sure you have dotnet 6.0 or newer installed on your machine. Open 
a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program 
by running the following commands.
```
dotnet build
dotnet run 
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. 
Start your IDE and open the project folder. Select "Run and Debug" on 
the Activity Bar. Next, select the project you'd like to run from the 
drop down list at the top of the Side Bar. Lastly, click the green 
arrow or "start debugging" button.

```
